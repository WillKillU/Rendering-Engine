# OpenGL-RenderingEngine

Here is my OpenGL Rendering Engine project. This is a school project made in 4 weeks. The goal was to recreate from scratch a rendering engine, with an entity-component system. I really like architecting my code, so this projet is more about architecture than having cool things on the screen. I tried some fancy stuffs, like launching my engine from Unity and serlializing data using XML.

So in this project you'll mainly find :

- An idea of architecture for a rendering engine
- A cool link between Unity and my Engine
- Data serialization using XML
- A basic mesh without normals, textures, and anything else (No camera too...)

You'll not find :

- Shader binding
- Textures on mesh
- Cameras
- Lights


Feel free to reuse this project and modify it. If someone is interested in doing OpenGL stuffs with it (Shaders, binding textures on meshes, lightings, cameras), enjoy using this architecture !
